<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Miles Phillips and I'm a junior here at Saint Mary's currently pursuing my Bachelors degree in Computer Science. I am more of an introverted person than most that likes sports like basketball and football, music like rap/hip-hop, R&B and more. I play club Lacrosse here at SMC and have been playing since fifth grade and I play intramural basketball here too just for fun.</p>
